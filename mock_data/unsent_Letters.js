		message: "You were the first family I ever had who didn't abuse me. You loved me, even when I hated myself and was fed up with you peeing on my carpet. You stopped my suicide attempts. You put your little chin on me every time I felt like there was no one in the world who loved me. I never had to pull you close to me when I was upset, you just knew that I needed you."
		+ " If I ever left your side, you would whine and try to come to me. I know it wasn't because you didn't want to be alone; you wanted to make sure I was protected."
		+ " You were the best protector I've ever had. When you were sleeping beside me I knew nothing bad would happen. All the sudden, I was happy to wake up because I loved the little squeak you made as you stretched out at my feet. I wasn't alone in this world anymore, and although that feeling was brief, it was amazing."
		+ " And then, seven months ago, you didn't wake up one morning. You died gaurding my front door -- gaurding me. I didn't sleep for days after that and I cried all night, every night for months. Sometimes, when I come home and unlock my door, I pretend you are still here. I call out your name and every single time a part of me hopes you'll jump off your spot on the couch and come to me. But you are gone. I wish you were back home with me, but I need to stop hoping that's going to change."
		+ " I am supposed to adopt a new dog in a few months, but I don't want you to think I'm forgetting about you or replacing you. I just need someone to carry your torch. I can't exist in this world alone now that I've known what it's like to be loved so deeply. I wish you could tell me that that's what you want for me. That's what I would want for you, if I had died first and so I think it's fair to think you'd want the same for me. But knowing that doesn't make any of this much easier."
		+ " I want to say thank you. Thank you for making me believe that I am loved and cared for, and for giving me the family I had never had. Love is infinite. You showed me this, and because of this I will be able to hold you in my heart forever while still loving another dog just as much."
		+ " Love you always."
